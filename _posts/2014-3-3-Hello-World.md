Industry experts call AI as augmented intelligence instead of artificial, as it will help our intelligence. Though AI, we can automate the tedious tasks where we can free up our actual human intelligence to solve world problems. There is a lot of data out there in the world. According to Chris Skinner, data is future’s currency. But to be factual, data especially unstructured data that we have is nothing, just a heap without our ability to process it. Data processing and making models out of it to give customer better experience is available to us because of machine learning mainly. 
If we just take in information without applying it, it is as good as nothing. Same is the case with data. If we have a lot of data without the ability and infrastructure to process it, it becomes worthless. To the naked eye, that big amount of data has literally negative value owing to the cost of storage.
There are three types of AI
1.	Weak or narrow AI – for a specific domain. Basically, we know the kind of data we have and we know the outcome that we want. It is like the low-paying jobs of the world, where we have laborers who do exactly what we want them to do without having to think about it or doing something creative. 
2.	Strong AI or generalized AI – it can learn. It can also be thought of as a combination of various weak AIs’. It is like general jobs, where people learn to grow. For a better livelihood, they learn and prosper.
3.	Super AI or conscious AI – when it is not artificial anymore. It can be just like a human, learning things, and being aware, being able to process more data and adapt to situations. It’s a thing of the future.

The reason I think AI can change the world is because humans are the only ones who are capable of thinking, creating and solving problems. And as cliché as it sounds, we are human. We understand emotions. But the point I want to make is, we are a population of 7.8 billion people. Roughly 60% of the people can be working. I wonder what will happen if these matured minds collectively work towards making world a better place instead of doing menial tasks, we can actually recognize our world better, we can discover better medicines, have better environment-friendly technologies, can know our universe much better- the possibilities are endless. And that is world, which can be like Wakanda – so technologically advanced, resource-rich and with better human happiness index. That is the reason I think we should all learn AI and try to automate as much as we can. Because I think that AI is the future and we all will be better knowing it. One of the things that Elon Musk said is- try to make wherever you work as a better place. And that’s it. All these small little drops of nuggets, will collectively drive human race to a better tomorrow.
While there are a lot of sources to learn AI, one of the best among them is – Coursera - IBM Applied AI Professional Certificate.
